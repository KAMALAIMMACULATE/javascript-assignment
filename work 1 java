MY ALORITHM WAKING UP

I wake up in the morning
I  pray 
Make my bed
Brush my teeth and bath
smear my body with oil
put on clothes and shoes
Go for morning tea
Go to class.
function tiredChecker () {
  var getTired="sleep";
  var response
  if(getTired) {
    return response="sleep";
  } else{
    return response="goRead";
   }
  }
console.log(tiredChecker());
